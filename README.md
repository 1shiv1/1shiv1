GUARDS
He's getting away! Get him! This
way! Turn!
Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared for a moment then he spots the guards
coming up the path. He quickly hides behind Shrek.
HEAD GUARD
You there. Ogre!
SHREK
Aye?
HEAD GUARD
By the order of Lord Farquaad I am
authorized to place you both under
arrest and transport you to a
designated resettlement facility.
SHREK
Oh, really? You and what army?
He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as
well and we see that the other men have run off. The guard
tucks tail and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about
his business and begins walking back to his cottage.
DONKEY
Can I say something to you? Listen,
you was really, really, really
somethin' back here. Incredible!
SHREK
Are you talkin' to...(he turns
around and Donkey is gone) me? (he
turns back around and Donkey is
right in front of him.) Whoa!
DONKEY
Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I
tell you that you that you was
great back here? Those guards! They
thought they was all of that. Then
you showed up, and bam! They was
trippin' over themselves like babes
in the woods. That really made me
feel good to see that.
SHREK
Oh, that's great. Really.
